# CoCoPops/RollingStone/OriginalFiles/

This directory contains the original data for the CoCoPops rolling stone dataset.


## Directory organization

The `/OriginalFiles` directory contains the transcriptions using a novel, non-standardized, encoding scheme by de Clercq and Temperley each of the two hundred songs, two harmonic transcriptions (one by each author; .txt files) and one melodic transcription (by one or the other author; .mel files) are encoded in three separate text files. Timestamp information (timestamps for each downbeat in the recording) is also encoded in a separate file (.tim files). This puts the data into four separate files. Additionally, some songs also have associated .str files which contain the lyrics of the songs.
