This dataset is a translation of de Clercq and Temperley's Rolling Stone Corpus (http://rockcorpus.midside.com/) into the humdrum (www.humdrum.org) format.

This WorkLog file was used to keep notes on progress on this project before it was turned into a git repository.

The files Corpus.tsv is a table of metadata about the pieces, which was used to populate the reference records of the humdrum files.

%%%%%%%%% ZipFiles

The ZipFiles directory includes the original zip files downloaded from rockcorpus.midside.com on February 3rd, 2019.

%%%%%%%%% OriginalFiles

These are the original unzipped files. 
For each song there are four separate files:
1) a harmonic analysis by Trevor de Clercq;
2) a harmonic analysis by David Temperley;
3) a melodic transcription by either de Clercq or Temperley. 


I've made a number of fixes to errors in these files:

Strange warning records appear in the first records of five files, where the title of the song is supposed to be:
	both_sides_now_tdc.txt	->	Warning: 'In' is defined but never used
	lets_get_it_on_dt.txt	->	Warning: 'Vr2' is defined but never used
	living_for_the_city_tdc.txt	->	Warning: 'B' is defined but never used
	papa_was_a_rollin_stone_tdc.txt	->	Warning: 'Ch2' is defined but never used
	who_do_you_love_dt.txt	->	Warning: 'Ch5' is defined but never used
	who_do_you_love_dt.txt	->	Warning: 'Vr5' is defined but never used

These warnings were removed.

Several .tim are files simply are named wrong. I've correct them:
	youve_got_that_lovin_feelin.tim -> youve_lost_that_lovin_feelin.tim
	brown_eyed_girl.tim -> brown-eyed_girl.tim

A number of the original encodings have a particular inconsistency between the melodic and harmonic transcriptions,
with the mismatch of time signatures between the melodic and harmonic transcriptions.
In many cases the scribe simply neglected to indicate a time signature at the beginning of the harmonic transcriptions which is present
in the melodic transcription---in almost all cases, a compound-douple meter in the melodic transcription is absent from the harmonic transcriptions.
In other words, the melody is transcribed as 12/8, but they didn't indicate this in the harmonic transcription.
(Often the "mistake" is because the piece, especially considering the harmonic in issolation, is closer to in a 4/4 shuffle than a true 12/8).
	I've fixed this by adding time signatures into harmonic encodings of the following files (in the "Original_Files" directory):
		a_change_is_gonna_come (12/8)
		be-bop-a-lula (12/8)
		blueberry_hill (12/8)
		california_girls (12/8)
		crazy (12/8)
		da_doo_ron_ron (12/8)
		earth_angel (12/8)
		georgia_on_my_mind (12/8)
		god_only_knows (12/8)
		good_vibrations (12/8)
		heartbreak_hotel (12/8)
		hound_dog (12/8)
		i_cant_stop_loving_you (12/8)
		in_the_still_of_the_night (12/8)
		london_calling (12/8)
		please_please_please (12/8)
		rock_around_the_clock (12/8)
		shake_rattle_and_roll (12/8)
		thatll_be_the_day (12/8)
		tutti_frutti (12/8)
		when_a_man_loves_a_woman (12/8)
		whole_lotta_shakin_goin_on (12/8)
		you_send_me (12/8)

		hallelujah (6/8)
		house_of_the_rising_sun (6/8)
		i_only_have_eyes_for_you (6/8)
		ive_been_loving_you_too_long (6/8)
		norwegian_wood (6/8)

		im_so_lonely_i_could_cry (9/8)

		the_times_they_are_a-changin (3/4)

		mystery_train (missing one measure of 2/4 at beginning)
		ring_of_fire (missing one measure of 3/4 at beginning)

		blue_suede_shoes (alternating 6/8 and 12/8 at beginning didn't quite match. It was missing the first 12/8.)

Some songs have inconsistent keys between transcriptions.
In some cases, these are legitimate disagreements about what the key is (for instance, is vi in C major, or i in A minor?).
However, there are a number of cases of arbitrary enharmonic disgagreement (Ab vs G#). 
I've change melodic files to be consistent with the harmonic files in:

	love_and_happiness G# -> Ab
	sabotage G# -> Ab
	the_message G# -> Ab
	you_really_got_me G# -> Ab

	nothing_but_a_g_thang empty -> B
	foxey_lady empty -> F#
	
	i_walk_the_line removed [F] at the beginning because it starts in [Bb]

	light_my_fire remove [Db] at beginning because it starts on [F#]; changed Gb -> F# 

	california_dreamin C# -> Db

	good_vibrations Gb -> F#
	in_the_still_of_the_night Gb -> F#
	the_sounds_of_silence Gb -> F#

Unfortunately, since the harmonic transcriptions don't explicitely indicate mode, AND there is the possibility of legitimate disagreement regarding 
key/mode between two transcribers, I elected to automatically resolve mode disagreements by manually inspecting humdrum files.

%%%%%%%%% HumdrumFiles

I wrote a Haskell parser which translates and combines the original melodic and harmonic transcriptions into a single humdrum file, using *tb for melodic rhythm.

Two songs (layla and crazy) have key changes mid measure, which my parser is not ready for.
I fix these manually after auto parsing is complete.
In layla, one of the two harmonic transcriptions also fail to change keys mid measure.

Shout has a weird "commented" breakdown which is messing up my parser. I am changing the | bars from this passage to :, so the parser doesn't trip on it.
Strawberry fields has the same problems.

%%%%%%%%% Tempos


The files Tempos.tsv lists the bpm(s) for each file, based on my tapping along to them using the https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm tool.
Using the InsertTempos.R script, these tempos are inserted into the humdrum files.
For files with multiple tempos, the actual location of tempo changes in the humdrum file has to be input manually (after the fact).
