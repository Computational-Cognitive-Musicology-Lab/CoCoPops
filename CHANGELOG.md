# 0.9.0.0 (2023-11-22)

## Changes 

We've incorporated updated (better aligned) versions of the Billboard valence-arousal subset files.


## Notes

The dataset is now *almost* entirely complete and consistent with what we described in our 2023 paper in the proceedings of *International Conference for Music Information Retrieval* ([ISMIR 2023](https://ismir2023.ismir.net/)).
We have a few things to wrap up, but should have those finished in the next month.
