# CoCoPops/RollingStone/Humdrum

This directory contains the humdrum data for the CoCoPops rolling stone dataset.


## Directory organization

The `/Humdrum` directory contains files in the humdrum syntax, with the four original files encoded in four spines of a single humdrum file. Using humdrum makes the data accessible to humdrum tools, and also allows us to include metadata for each song in the file, using humdrum tandem interpretations and reference records.
