# CoCoPops/Billboard/MelodicTranscriptions/

This is the folder where we keep non-humdrum melodic transcription data, including Sibelius and XML files.
The XML files are the most important, as XML is the format which will be translated to Humdrum.

> I'd like to phase the Sibelius and Musescore files out completely, and do all editing directly on XML (using Musescore).

There is also a subdirectory called `TranscriptionResources` which contains some FakeBook and MIDI data for some of the sampled songs---these files are used by transcribers to jump-start the transcription process.
