# CoCoPops/Billboard/Resources

This directory contains files that are not part of the "main" CoCoPops dataset, but were used as part of the process of generating CoCoPops Billboard.
We include them in case they are useful, and as documentation of our process.

+ `McGill_Data` contains the original McGill data that we used to initialize our data.
+ `Scripts` contains various scripts used for processing the data at various times (mostly defunct now).
+ `Transcription` contains files related to the melodic transcription process.
