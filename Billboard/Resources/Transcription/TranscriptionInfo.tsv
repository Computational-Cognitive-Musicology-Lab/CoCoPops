AliceCooper_SchoolsOut_1972	Alice Cooper	School's Out	midi	Nat Condit-Schultz	1/27/17	The McGill transcription is clearly of the wrong track---I believe it's the album version of the song. It has the key as D#m, when the true key is Em. Their harmonic interpretation of the main riff is also bizzare. Also, the verse section isn't labelled as such and the single version is much shorter. Modulation to Gm in chorus, but hard to say where modulation occurs.	Made extensive changes, both to match singe version of track (not album version) but also some interpretive changes regarding pedal tones.

AnitaBaker_CaughtUpInTheRapture_1987	Anita Baker	Caught Up In The Rapture	_	Jonathan Eldridge	5/9/20	"Big scoops up into phrases (over many pitches) marked with glissandos On the chorus, there are some sharp slides between notes, which I marked with the 32nd dotted 16th fig. with gliss that you'll see a lot; I differentiated them from graces because they're in time in a strange way, and much sharper than a grace Coming off a note the pitch, the ending syllable is sometimes a different pitch, and in these cases I used an x-head grace; sometimes Anita ""ghost sings"" lines and these audible releases are the only way to tell when she actually stops singing"	"Added prominent harmonic syncopation in into/interlude. Renamed ""chorus->prechorus"" and ""bridge->chorus."" Cut off last 16-measures (the single version is shorter)."

AnneMurray_CouldIHaveThisDance_1980	Anne Murray	Could I Have This Dance	midi	Hubert Leveille Gauvin; Nat Condit-Schultz	2016-06-22; 2019-10-15	I think that the McGill data is based on the 1997 live version, which is much longer and a tone higher, rather than based on the actual hot 100 single. I transcribed the single version.	I've fixed the harmonic transcription to match the single version (like it's suppose to), but haven't reall listened through it to make sure it is correct (i.e., the chords are all the same).

But then it seems to be missing a whole section, as it goes directly into the outro. Maybe it was transcribed from a radio edit version? My transcriptions matches the McGill file. (I've started to update the melodic transcription to the correct length. Still need to do the harmonic transcription, and make corrections to the melodic transcription. -Nat)	_

I've changed it to 4/4 but we still need to fix the chords...which aren't quite right. - In fact, the chords in this song are way too detailed---grabbing every passing chord, etc.

Also, I respelled some of the flat chords in the chromatic ascent, so we get slightly less crazy functional harmonies in E major.

Commodores_Easy_1977	Commodores	Easy	midi	_	_	_	McGill was missing key change to A major at end. I've added it. I've also respelled B as Cb. This song is also written in double time...probably to allow them to incorporate (roughly) harmonic syncopations in their system...it should be re written at half the tempo (two chords per bar).
Commodores_Lady_1981	Commodores	Lady (You Bring Me Up)	_	Jonathan Eldridge	4/24/20	There are a couple sections where the pitch is a little strange--not out of tune or unpitched, but just probably not what they meant to sing. Apparently, there's multiple cuts of the single version; there's an ad-lib at mm. 39 that’s in one version and not another	Removed extra measure before the bridge. I'm not sure about these chords...

(Nat: I changed Jonathan's transcription to match the McGill's 12/8).	Removed a strange change to 6/4 near the very end.

GratefulDead_SugarMagnolia_1973	Grateful Dead	Sugar Magnolia	_	Jonathan Eldridge	4/24/20	The song fully modulates at mm.  97, and since this is a full modulation that continues, I just changed key signatures Couple of 2/4 measures in the song, which I just matched up with where they fell in the harmonic transcription, since the intended phrasing of them is a little debatable. Harmonies were tricky, because movement in the four parts wasn't always similar, sometimes 3 part would go to 2, etc.	_

Heart_CrazyOnYou_1978	Heart	Crazy On You	midi	Jonathan Eldridge	5/15/20	"The beginning is freeform and improvisatory, so I just matched it up with the harmonic trans.  There's a modulation at mm 65 that lasts long enough to justify a key change, but it isn't permanent so I used accidentals mm 69, 88, phrasing shifts from 16th 8th phrasing in mm 67 to straight 8th notes Tons of slurs over several beats; I marked high and low pitches and used glisses to connect them There's not a counterline and melody, but the melody often overlaps itself, so I have multiple parts in one staff--until the end when ""true"" polyphony starts; that said, this strategy was painstaking when it came to  lyrics and I'm not doing it again The various iterations of ""crazy on you"" were very slightly different in handling of melisma"	"This song needs to add syncopated chord changes added. Also, why is the whole intro ""N""?"

JamesBrown_IDontMind_1961	James Brown	I Don't Mind	_	Jonathan Eldridge	4/24/20	"On mm. 14 and 22 there is lost time; I think the rhythm section screwed up, but there's a few beats that get misplaced; I think it's coming from the phrasing of a melodic line there as what would be a quarter note triplet in duple, but instead its just three quarter notes here, and so there's some different interpretations of that throughout the band There is sometimes a slight swing on the 16th notes, especially on """"you gonna miss me"""""	Switched from 6/8 to 12/8.

LesleyGore_CaliforniaNights_1967	Lesley Gore	California Nights	_	Jonathan Eldridge	2020-05-??	This song is harmonically bizarre.	I that the chorus modulates to F minor---its the only way this makes any sense. I've added this to the humdrum. I've also respelled E as Fflat---which is strange, but it avoids the melody jumping between g sharp and a flat.

Also, I think it makes more sense to call each strophe a ""verse"" rather than a chorus."

Oliver_GoodMorningStarshine_1969	Oliver	Good Morning Starshine	_	Jonathan Eldridge	5/7/20	At the 'good morning' portions, there is an extra syllable in between 'good' and 'morning' used as a sort of turnaround between the words, which I notated as 'dm'. According to the lyrics it's just 'as we sing' but he definitely reemphasizes 'sing', so I put 'singing' Towards the improvised ending portion there's a line that says 'song a' sing', although one of the versions of the lyrics I found said 'the' instead of 'a' but some versions of lyrics didn't include the ending portion at all, so I put what I heard. The key is in between B and Bb; I (Nat) transposed Jonathan's transcription down to the McGill Bb.	_

ALSO, the McGill file doesn't have the last few measures before the fade out. ALSO, the last chords for the McGill file starting ms. 95 seem to be wrong (listed as A, should probably be D.) ALSO, I wasn't sure about hearing the correct register for the electric guitar, so some help there would be nice.	_
TheKinks_TillTheEndOfTheDay_1966	The Kinks	Till The End Of The Day	midi	Jonathan Eldridge	6/1/20	_	The McGill transcription appears to be of a live version (the ending is quite different which I had to change). Thus the timestamps are wrong and I deleted them. There were also a few extra measures to delete before the solo. Finally, their section labels were nonsensensical, as they failed to recognize the verse/chorus pattern. I've added corrected section labels. (What to call the opening chorus is an interesting question.) They also notate all chords as power chords, when the guitar is playing full triads which I've fixed.

WilsonPhillips_HoldOn_1990	Wilson Phillips	Hold On	midi	Jonathan Eldridge	5/3/20	"Similar to Leslie “California Nights”; ghosted attacks are sometimes given enough of a value to be considered their own notes, and sometimes not. They sometimes sing the same word over a melisma using very different vowel sounds; I tried to reflect this in the lyrics Ghosted notes on lyrics were close enough to pitch to warrant ""x"" Dense instrumentation; for a lot of the lower part of the harmonies I was listening for subtones, which is why there's proportionately more ""x's"" in that part"	Added one measure to the fadeout. Changed harmonic rhythm throughout to match the syncopated harmonic rhythm. Also, subbed a Amin chord for Fmaj(1st inversion).
