# XML files


This directory includes musicXML files for each melodic transcription in the Billboard dataset.
These XML were generated first, generally using MuseScore or Sibelius, then converted to humdrum later.
However, since then, changes have been made to the primary humdrum data files, so these xml files are not necessarily up to date.
