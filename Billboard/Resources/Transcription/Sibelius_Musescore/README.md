# Musescore and Sibelius files


This directory includes Musescore and Sibelius files for some of the melodic transcription in the Billboard dataset.
These files were converted to, XML then converted to humdrum later for the final data set.
Since then, changes have been made to the primary humdrum data files (and/or XML files), these files are not necessarily up to date with anything else.
