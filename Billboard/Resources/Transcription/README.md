# CoCoPops/Billboard/Resources/Transcription

This directory contains files related to our melodic transcription process.
The file `TranscriptionInfo.tsv` indicates the transcription status of all songs in the datasets, including any notes taken during transcription.

Generally, transcriptions were created in MuseScore or Sibelius, then exported as musicXML, then translated to humdrum format.
Many of the original Sibelius/Musescore files, and all of the musicXML files are stored here in subdirectories `Sibelius_Musescore` and `XML` respectively.
There is also a subdirectory called `TranscriptionResources` which contains some FakeBook and MIDI data for some of the sampled songs---these files are used by transcribers to jump-start the transcription process.

> Note that many of the primary humdrum data files have been edited since their initial conversion from XML, and these updates have not been back propagated to the XML (or Sibelius/Musescore) files.
> This means that the files in this directory may be out of date, to some extent.
