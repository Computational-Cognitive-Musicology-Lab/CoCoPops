# CoCoPops: The Coordinated Corpus of Popular Musics
## A meta-corpus of melodic and harmonic transcriptions of popular music 

This meta-corpus currently contains two sub-corpora, Billboard and Rolling Stone, converted to a common (humdrum) format, and we plan on continuing to add more as additional datasets and corpora of popular music with melodic transcriptions become available.

The `Billboard` corpus contains both converted transcriptions from the original McGill Billboard Dataset (Burgoyne et al., 2011) into humdrum, as well as a subset (currently 214 songs) with expert transcriptions of the melodies and lyrics time-aligned with the harmony, formal labels, etc.
Currently each corpus has its own parent directory and sub-directory structure.
The `RollingStone` corpus contains converted transcriptions from the original RS200 corpus of melody and harmony (de Clercq & Temperley, 2011) into humdrum format, with some updates and additional data manipulations provided.


**Each corpus (directory) has its own README file with detailed explanations of the directory structure and contents.**
