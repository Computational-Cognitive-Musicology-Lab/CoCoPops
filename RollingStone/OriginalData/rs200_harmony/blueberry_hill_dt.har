In: IV | | I | |
Vr: IV | | I | | V7 | | I IV | I |
  % iv in m. 7 varies: IV over I in Vr1, iih65 (actually I hear A AND Ab!) in Vr2 and Vr3, then just added 6th in Vr4.
  % On 2nd and 3rd verses (before bridge), final half-measure is indistinct - maybe bVII? (V7 is suggested
  % by melody and would be logical but I can't hear it in instruments)
